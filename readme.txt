The associated tableau workbook synthesizes citi bike data from September 2022 - September 2023. 
A randomized selection of 15% of entries from each month's dataset was combined to make a manageable representation of 1 year worth of data.

Upon analysis of the data from Sep. 2022 - Sep. 2023 several interesting observations have been made:

1. The amount of member riders outnumbers casual riders. However, casual riders take longer rides on average than member riders (story pg. 2 line charts).
  - The implication is that members and casual riders comprise two different rider groups. Riders who take frequent short rides and riders who take infrequent long rides.

2. Classic bike usage comprises the vast majority of bike rides. Electric bikes have not seen any significant growth over the course of the year.
  - Bike usage is greatest in Summer (around July - September) and drops in Winter (December - February) (story pg. 1/3 dynamic map).
  - However, while classic bike usage fluctuated over the course of the year, electric bike usage stayed consistent (story pg. 3 line chart).
  - This implies that bike usage is heavily affected by time of the year, but users of electric bikes are more likely to continue riding throughout the year.

3. Bike rides were most frequent in Manhattan and far less used outside of the Manhattan Area (story pg. 4/5 dynamic maps).
  - Ridership was observed to have two distinct patterns (story pg. 4 dynamic bar charts):
    - Weekend rides which are frequent in the afternoon to evening.
    - Weekday rides which occur most often around 9AM and 5PM.
  - This observation implies riding is used as a work commuting option in the Manhattan area, but is not used to travel between boroughs.
  - The region of usage doesn't change between weekday and weekend which implies that a majority of riders reside in and work in the Manhattan area.
